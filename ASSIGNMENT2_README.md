Description: The entirety of Machine Learning Assignment 2 was completed in Jupiter Notebook. The emphasis of this assignment is on Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. With the help of the NumPy module, we can access arrays and change their dimensions, turning a 1-D array into a 2-D array or 3-D array, for example. By employing indexing, we may change those values. We have a pandas library where we can import system-generated files like text, csv, and excel, apply various functions to edit and analyze the data, and also use pandas to portray our data aesthetically. plotting operation We put our data in a scatter plot using the plot function. Matplotlib allows us to visualize data in bar charts, scatter plots, and other graphic formats.We have matplotlib, which allows us to depict our data as graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, bar charts, and other graphic formats. In this assignment, we used a pie chart to visualize our data.
