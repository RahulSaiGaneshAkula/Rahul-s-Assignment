Description: Machine Learning Assignment 2 is done completely using Jupiter Notebook. This Assignment focuses on the python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib. we can access arrays using NumPy module and we can convert these array into different dimensions i.e., converting 1-D array into 2-D array or 3-D array. we can modify those values using indexing. To analyze the data we have pandas library where we can load files like text, csv, excel from the system and apply different functions to modify, analyze the data and also can represent our data in visually using pandas.plot function. Using that plot function we represented our data in scatter plot. To represent out data in visual format we have matplotlib where we can represent data in Bar Charts, Scatter plot, pie charts and graphs. In this Assignment we represented our data in a pie chart.
