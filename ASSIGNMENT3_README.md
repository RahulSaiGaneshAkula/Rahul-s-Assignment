Machine Learning Assignment 3 is done completely using Jupiter Notebook. This assignment focuses on handling supervised data classification using python sklearn library. 
In this assignment, we imported few data files using read_cdv method and found the correlation between two columns and visually presented the correlation between columns 
using sea-born python library. Naive Bayes and Support vector machine algorithms are applied on the data sets imported. Before applying these algorithms over data, first 
we preprocessed the dataset to remove null and noisy data present in it. After preprocessing, we applied Machine Algorithms over the data and found the confusion matrix 
and accuracy. On Glass Data set, we found that Naive Bayes is performing better than the SVM based on the accuracy.
