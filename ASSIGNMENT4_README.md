Rahul Sai Ganesh Akula 700741923 Description:Jupiter Notebook was used exclusively to complete Machine Learning Assignment 4. As part of this project, I used the read 
csv method to import a few CSV files. I then trained a linear regression model on the Salary Data data set and calculated the mean square error. Additionally, a scatter
plot using the Matplotlib tool was created utilizing the training and testing data. Additionally, I discovered the silhouette score of the raw data after training the
KMeans algorithm on the K-Mean dataset. I applied feature scaling using the standard scaler method from the Sklearn library to the K-Mean dataset. Later, after using
this preprocessed dataset to train KMeans, I discovered the silhouette score. When I compared these two silhouette scores, the raw data outperformed the preprocessed
data in terms of silhouette score.
